## (1) Description

A personal project to create a react MERN stack app which has a number of simple games. I used trial and error and ChatGPT prompting. 

This was built with React, Matter.js, ~~react-spring~~ Node, Javascript, and CSS. 

Game was divided up into the smallest working components/units. It began as a game screen with a moving ship, then a couple of asteroids which moved randomly. Collision detection, physics and projectile shooting were put in later. Made three different versions to test alternate physics.

## (3) Visuals

[Visit App deployed to Heroku](.../)

![bandpage-screenshot](...)

## (4) Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sifzerda/bandpage.git
cd bandpage
npm install
npm run start
```

## (5) Usage

Technologies:

+ express
+ graphql
+ mongodb
+ axios
+ socket.io
+ react-router
+ react-youtube
+ react-draggable
+ react-player

## (6) Dev Stuff: Building:

The main functions of code:

Features: 

(1) User Authentication and Accounts
+ Sign Up, Login, Logout

(2) News and Activity
+ Submit Notes and Updates
+ Data sent to MongoDB, accessed with graphql
+ Create/Read/Update/Delete Functions

(3) Calender
+ Users can indicate availability by switching color of date to red/green/white
+ User changes are updated and saved instantly over WebSocket Server

(4) Music Player:
+ play, pause, next/prev song
+ imported inside App.jsx outside react-router outlet so the player persists after nav tab switch, and playback continues.
+ User can play any song saved from youtube search

(5) Song Suggestions:
+ Embedded YouTube search using YouTube Data API v3
+ Search for youtube videos/music, play in embedded player
+ User can save video results to music player. HandleSaveVideo prop passes from Suggestions page to music player at the global level (in App.jsx, outside react-router-outlet) allowing song to play even after page switched via nav tabs
+ Search has a keydown function to allow search to run by pressing enter

## (8) Bugs and Further Development: 

- occasionally asteroids are spawned which seem to lack collision detection so you can't hit or crash into them.
- spam shooting gunfire everywhere trips up the collision detection and won't hit asteroids.

Optimization:
- use react-virtualized to only render visible stuff
- once game basically running, convert it into Redux or Zustand
- use a bundler like Webpack or Parcel to optimize build output: Enable code splitting, tree-shaking, and minification to reduce bundle size and improve load times.
- Consider memoizing components like Projectile and Particle using React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders, especially if their props rarely change.

## (9) To do: 

- [x] alt screens: start game, game over, score submission etc
- [x] make layout distinct from minesweeper and solitaire
- [x] Create basic black game screen
- [x] Create moving ship 
- [x] Create some randomly moving asteroids
- [x] Make more asteroids and different size asteroids
- [x] Enable projectile firing
- [x] make rocket exhaust
- [x] ~~timer, score count every asteroid hit~~
  - [x] Or one single score count which is continuously running up (like a timer) and gets extra increments every asteroid destroyed
- [x] Gunfire decay and boundary wrapping
- [x] Projectile collision detection with asteroids
- [x] Ship detection with asteroids
- [x] When you shoot an asteroid it disappears
  - [x] When you shoot asteroids they break into two smaller, and so on
- [ ] improve graphics elements
- [x] refine ship movement; add limited inertia
- [ ] bullet flashing/muzzle flare effect
- [ ] asteroids flash or change color when hit
- [ ] Power ups randomly appear around screen for several seconds which change projectile type/power/appearance:
  - [ ] Boost (or add boost ability in general)
- [x] ~~Level progression:~~
  - [ ] ~~Higher level (i.e. more time) asteroids take longer to break up, or break up into smaller divisions~~
- [x] ~~Dividing play session into levels. After a certain time, 'level 2' flashes on screen and difficulty ramps each level increase.~~

Navigation:

- [x] Game Start screen
- [x] Game win/loss screen
  - ~~[ ] Timer~~
  - [x] Score
  - ~~[ ] Total level~~
- [ ] Exit game through main game
- [x] Highscores (from start screen)
- [x] Submit highscores
- [x] Profile scores and logging in
